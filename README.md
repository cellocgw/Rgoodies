Toys and tools not worthy of being built into a CRAN-style package

I intend to put simple tools and various game-like functions I've written here.  Examples of things to come:
1) simple image distortion tools to apply "swirls" or "wiggles" to an image
2) Stuff not worth putting into one of the more clearly - named repositories.

For the time being, at least, I'm not planning to migrate my CRAN packages here.
