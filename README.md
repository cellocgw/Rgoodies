Toys and tools not worthy of being built into a CRAN-style package

I intend to put simple tools and various game-like functions I've written here.  Examples of things to come:
1) ASCII-art version of the 2048 game
2) code to draw mazes, and then to solve them
3) simple image distortion tools to apply "swirls" or "wiggles" to an image
4) pointless snippets to generate dynamic prompts (e.g. with current working directory embedded)

For the time being, at least, I'm not planning to migrate my CRAN packages here.
