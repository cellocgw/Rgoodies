Toys and tools not worthy of being built into a CRAN-style package

I intend to put simple tools and various game-like functions I've written here.  Examples of things to come:
1) simple image distortion tools to apply "swirls" or "wiggles" to an image
2) Stuff not worth putting into one of the more clearly - named repositories.

Quick info:

interpHyper:  a rewrite of e1071::interpolate to be faster (I think) and more robust. This interpolates data in N-space.

newtonfractal:  generate fractal data by using Newton-Raphson iteration to find which root of (typically complex) a polynomial each point converges to.  Includes code to make pretty plots of the output.
